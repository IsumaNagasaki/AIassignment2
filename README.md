install and set IntelliJ IDEA (I use Community Edition 2021.1) (you may use another ways to compile and run java projects, but I cannot be sure how to work with them)

If you want to put your image to be processed, put it into the root folder of the project (Imag)

Your image should be ".jpg" format and named ("image1.jpg")

Default image is already there, you can run code with it

In the IDE run class Test (Test.main())

Please, do not move the window, where the pictures are going to be painted (it will appear, when you run the code)

Even if you moved the window, the result image will be in the root folder of project with name "RESULT.jpg", when the algorithms finish.

If you moved, the project will restart, so better stop it manually.

While project is running, in the same folder you can see the stages. When it is rerun, the pictures will be rewritten.
